Would you eat them
in a box?
Would you eat them
with a fox?

Not in a box. 
Not with a fox.
Not in a house.
Not with a mouse.
I would not eat them
here or there.
I would not eat them anywhere.
I would not eat green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.

Would you? Could you? In a car?
Eat them! Eat them! Here they are.
I would not, could not, in a car.

You may like them. You will see. 
You may like them in a tree!

I would not, could not in a tree.
Not in a car! You let me be.
